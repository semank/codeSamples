<span class="bluetext"><p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I websurfed, weak and weary,</p>
   <p>Over many a strange and spurious website of 'hot chicks galore',</p>
   <p>While I clicked my fav'rite bookmark, suddenly there came a warning,</p>
   <p>And my heart was filled with mourning, mourning for my dear amour.</p>
   <p>"'Tis not possible," I muttered, "give me back my cheap hardcore!" -</p>
<p>Quoth the server, "404".</p></span>
